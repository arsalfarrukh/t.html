    <h2>Here is a list of my projects:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Tic-Tac-Toe game: <img src="Tictactoe-winning-vector-639732.webp" alt="Tic-Tac-Toe Game Image"></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a project for a class assignment that I have created in the past. It is written in the Java programming language. The basic premise was to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game that is easy to use and interactive. The user is one of the players and is essentially like playing against a computer. Here is a link of the Java File with the code for the project/assignment:</p>
    <p><a href="GamePlayGUI (1).java">GamePlayGUI (1).java</a></p>
    <p>This link demonstrates the full code used in a GitHub repository for easy viewing. Here is a screenshot of some of what you will be viewing in case the link does not work:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>2. Data Structures Project: <img src="0_iVjz5z5UOsm0rL6J.jpg" alt="Data Structures Image"></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This project involved creating various Data Structures, such as Linked Lists and Binary Trees, very important concepts for any IT field. The goal was to gain more experience with using the data structures, as well as to help grasp all the important topics mentioned, and to provide a smooth, interactive experience for any potential users so they can easily learn as well. Here is the Java code used for this project:</p>
    <p><a href="Main (9).java">Main (9).java</a></p>
    <p>This link shows the full code mentioned above in the GitHub repository, again, for easy reference. Here is a screenshot of a portion of the code in case the link does not work:</p>
